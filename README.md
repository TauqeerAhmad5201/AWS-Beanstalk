# AWS-Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows developers to deploy and manage web applications and services with ease. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS-managed service for web applications. Elastic Beanstalk is a pre-configured EC2 server that candirectly take up your application code and environment configurations and use it to automatically provision and deploy the required resources within AWS to run the web application.

Unlike EC2 which is Infrastructure as a service, Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform As A Service  as it allows users to directly use a pre-configured server for their application. Of course, you can deploy applications without ever having to use elastic beanstalk but that would mean having to choose the appropriate service from the vast array of services offered by  AWS, manually provisioning these AWS resources, and stitching them up together to form a complete web application.

Elastic Beanstalk abstracts the underlying configuration work and allows you as a user to focus on more pressing matters.
